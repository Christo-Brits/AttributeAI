🔍 OAUTH REDIRECT ISSUE - ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
============================================

🚨 PROBLEM: Still redirecting to localhost:3000

🎯 LIKELY CAUSES:

1. 🔧 SUPABASE SITE URL CONFIGURATION
   - Supabase "Site URL" setting may still be localhost:3000
   - This overrides all other redirect settings
   - Location: Auth > URL Configuration

2. 🔗 SUPABASE REDIRECT URLs
   - Additional redirect URLs not configured in Supabase
   - Need to add production domains to allowed redirects
   - Location: Auth > URL Configuration

3. 🌐 BROWSER CACHE
   - OAuth tokens/sessions cached from localhost testing
   - Old redirect URLs cached in browser
   - Solution: Clear all data for your sites

4. 📊 ENVIRONMENT MISMATCH
   - Production build using wrong environment variables
   - .env.production not being used correctly on Netlify

🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

✅ Check Supabase Site URL (most likely culprit)
✅ Check Supabase Additional Redirect URLs  
✅ Clear browser cache completely
✅ Test in incognito/private window

🎯 CRITICAL SETTINGS TO VERIFY:

Supabase Auth > URL Configuration:
- Site URL: https://leafy-biscotti-c87e93.netlify.app
- Additional redirect URLs: 
  * https://attributeai.app/**
  * https://leafy-biscotti-c87e93.netlify.app/**

🔧 If Site URL is localhost:3000, that's your problem!
