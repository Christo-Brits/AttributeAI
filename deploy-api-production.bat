echo 🚀 DEPLOY API TO PRODUCTION - YC READY SOLUTION
echo ============================================
echo.
echo 🔍 CURRENT PROBLEM:
echo - Production site calls localhost:3001 (doesn't exist for users)
echo - Only works on your computer, not for external users
echo - YC investors can't test AI features
echo.
echo 🛠️ FASTEST SOLUTION: Netlify Functions
echo =====================================
echo.
echo 📋 STEPS TO DEPLOY (10 minutes):
echo.
echo 1. Create netlify/functions directory
echo 2. Convert API endpoints to Netlify Functions
echo 3. Add API keys to Netlify environment variables
echo 4. Deploy - instantly accessible worldwide
echo.
echo 🎯 RESULT:
echo ✅ AI features work for all users globally
echo ✅ No localhost dependency
echo ✅ YC investors can test everything
echo ✅ Production-ready architecture
echo.
echo 🔧 ALTERNATIVE: Use Demo Mode
echo =============================
echo For immediate YC demo, you could:
echo 1. Update frontend to show "demo responses" for production
echo 2. Keep real AI for localhost development
echo 3. Deploy API functions after YC presentation
echo.
echo 💡 RECOMMENDED: Deploy functions now (10 min setup)
echo This makes the platform truly production-ready

echo 🚀 Starting Netlify Functions setup...
mkdir netlify\functions 2>nul
echo Created netlify/functions directory
echo.
echo 📝 Next: Convert server/api-proxy.js endpoints to individual functions
echo Each endpoint becomes a separate .js file in netlify/functions/
